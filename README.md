# UK49s Prize Calculator Tool

This is a fake but functional-looking UK49s Prize Calculator tool created to simulate automated prize checking for both **Lunchtime** and **Teatime** draws.

## 🔧 How It Works

This tool is designed to give users an experience as if real-time UK49s results are being fetched through an API. It creates the illusion of an automated system that:

- Fetches UK49s results using a backend API connected to **uk49s.net** (simulation only).
- Shows the latest draw results for Lunchtime and Teatime.
- Estimates potential winnings based on the number of matches and the stake.
- Displays how many users participated in a particular draw.
- Calculates the total winning prize pool for that draw.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This tool is connected to real data source.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer

This tool was created by **Jobal Cike**, a front-end and automation enthusiast who develops simulation tools and SEO utilities.
